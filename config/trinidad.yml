  # If you do not put a web-server in front of Trinidad you might tune asset caching :
  #public:
  #  root: public # same as the above "public: public" setting
  #  aliases: # allows to "link" other directories into the public root e.g. :
  #    /home: /var/local/www
  #  cached: true # enable (in-memory) asset caching on for env != 'development'
